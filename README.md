# fast-api-book-project
This project is to deploy a FastAPI application with a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline. I will use an existing template repository, add a missing endpoint, set up a test pipeline, and configure the deployment process. Your application should be served using Nginx.
